      <h2>My projects</h2>
      <p>I have created several projects during my first week at Epicodus.</p>
      <p>This is a list of my completed and semi-completed projects that are
      uploaded to GitHub.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Littlejoel29/Fake-Wiki.git">Fake Wiki</a>
         This was my attempt to duplicate the Wikipedia home page. I was less than
        successful in my attempt.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Littlejoel29/Vacation.git">Vacation</a>
         This is a project to develop a webpage that showed vacation pages to Rome, Italy.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Littlejoel29/Resume.git">Resume</a> This project
        was my attempt to create a near duplicate of my last resume. I think that
        it turned out pretty well.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Littlejoel29/Resort.git">Resort</a> This project
        created a multi-page website to showcase a tropical resort.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Littlejoel29/Commands.git">Commmands</a> This was
        a small website that was intended to list the most common GIT terminal commands
        and some basic HTML tags.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Littlejoel29/my-first-webpage.git">My-First-Webpage</a>
         This was a page that I created via copy + paste commands while following along
        to an instructional video on Tuesday. It also helped me learn how to type a
        Readme file.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Littlejoel29/Tabitha-s-Page.git">Tabitha-s-Page</a>
         This page is shows some basic info about my cat.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Littlejoel29/My-favorite-things.git">My-favorite-things</a>
        This was supposed to be a webpage based on a lesson from my second day here,
        but it did not upload to GitHub correctly.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Littlejoel29/Cookie-Indents.git">Cookie-Indents</a> This
        webpage was a project we downloaded from GitHub that had horrible indents and
        spacing in the HTML code, we had to fix it.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Littlejoel29/Goodbye.git">Goodbye</a> This
        page is just a basic HTML formatted website with instructions on how to say
        goodbye in several languages.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Littlejoel29/helloworld.git">helloworld</a> This
        page is just a basic HTML formatted website with instructions on how to say
        hello in several languages.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I am a 35 year old student at Epicodus. I have a very...unique...personality
      and I really hate filling out "About Me" sections as they make me feel
      <strong>uncomfortable.</strong>
      In the future, I will be using "Lorem ipsum" to fill out this portion of any
      other projects at Epicodus, regardless of your instructions. Sorry, that is
      just how it is. If I want you to know something about me I will tell you.
      If you want to know something specific, please ask me in private.
      <br>
      Having said that, I was adopted at 10 months old and I have lived my entire life
      in Washington State. I have <span>blue</span> eyes and my hair is
      dark brown.</p>
      <h3>My Background</h3>
      <p>My education and job experience is...diverse. I am a certified nursing
      assistant, I have been trained as a physical therapy assistant,
      an emergency first responder/EMT-A, and I have partially completed my
      licensed practical nursing classes. I have a background in debt collections
      and real estate title and escrow services. I have worked in a varity of jobs
      over the years. I have helped build computer networks, collected money owed
      to VoiceStream and T-Mobile. I have worked as a teller at a credit union and
      helped track down people that were hiding cars with delinquent loan balances.
      I spent 5 years working in title and escrow doing a variety of jobs and I have
      worked off and on as a certified nursing assistant for the last few years.
      I worked with dementia patients, hospice patients and stroke rehab patients.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I chose to take this class because I am tired to watching most of my
      patients die in agony. I am only allowed to help certain patients take
      their own lives (those that can afford the proper drugs) and I am
      required to help prevent all others from doing so, even if I must
      restrain them. <span>(Those patients cannot afford the cost of the end of life
      meds which can cost over $1000)</span> This is heart breaking and I am not able
      to continue doing this.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I <em>used</em> to be an armed hand-to-hand combat instructor for women
      entering college in Bellingham. I helped to teach women how to defend
      themselves from an attacker using what is in the environment around them.
      We gave classes at a local BDSM club. I currently help teach BDSM safety
      and sensual massage to couples at a local private night club three nights
      per week.</p>
      <h3>Current interests and hobbies</h3>
      <p>My hobbies include:
        <ol>
          <li>Golf</li>
          <li>Reading</li>
          <li>Computer gaming</li>
          <li>Roller-skating</li>
          <li>Short, medium and long-range shooting</li>
        </ol>
